				To Team GameBerry Labs,

				The idea of your startup on social based mobile game design gave me a spark and made me curious to be a part of your crew. I believe that I have the skills and potential to apply for Gameplay Programmer position that you advertised on AngelList. My ever desiring passion over game development made me to develop skills in the fields of programming, designing, gaming and managing a handful of projects and their deployment at the expected time. I see myself as a quick learner, and I’m looking forward to join an organization and manage projects with members of the team who are much passionate in the gaming industry. I currently pursue my CSE BTECH in MVIT, Puducherry & also possess experiences of game development in genres of 2D, 3D, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, Multiplayer Gaming,2D Vector Graphic Design, 3D Object Modelling, Version Control System & GIT, a decent knowledge of UNITY game engine and various kinds of sourcing for game design and development. I’ve been a gamer until date, I also understand the responsibility of being a game developer with complete sincerity as well as providing gameplay with fun social experiences. To further enhance your consideration, I would be a good source for creative ideas and a good asset to your game development projects. Thank you for your time and consideration, looking forward for an opportunity to proceed further as a member of GameBerry Labs.

				Sincerely,
				Varun Prakash
